    <h1>Trevor Taufa</h1>
    
    <p>Aloha! My name is Trevor Taufa. I am of Tongan descent and was born and raised in Australia. I am the <strong>10th child</strong> of <strong>13 children.</strong> There was always something to do growing up, and always something to play with or fight with (depending on what mood you're in.)</p>
    <p>Just like a lot of my siblings, we grew up playing a lot of sports. From what I can remember, my father always worked at least 2 jobs at a time to support the family financially. Even though he was a busy man working many jobs, he still managed to have time to take me to a lot of sports games. He'd take me on intercity trips to play rugby tournaments and was at Rugby games every weekend without fail.</p>
<br>
<p>Sports I've played competitively (in chronological order)</p>
<ol type="A">
    <li>Rugby Union</li>
    <li>Soccer</li>
    <li>Rugby League</li>
    <li>Track</li>
    <li>American Football</li>

    

</ol>
