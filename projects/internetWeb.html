    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>The word derives from the word Internetworking, which is what the internet is: a global network of interconnected computers.
        Like highways are to cars, the internet is a network for information to be exchanged and communicated to many other computers.
    </p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web, often shortened to the web, is a network of information that can be accessed via 
        the internet, as if the internet was is the road and highways and the web is the destinations people
    are trying to get to. Like the roads lead to homes and stores, the internet allows us to access various information
and sites. </p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>As explained earlier, the internet is the medium by which computers communicate to each other and 
        the web is a network if stored data that can be accessed.
    </p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>ASCII and Unicode are both character encoding standards that represent text and characters on computers.</p>
    <h4>ASCII</h4>
    <p>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a system that uses up to 8 bits to represent
        each character. Because a byte is only limited to 8 bits, the limit of characters in the ASCII system is 256.
        It was the  first major character encoding standard for data processing. </p>
    <h4>Unicode</h4>
    <p>Unicode is a unviersal character encoding standard that represents characters from many languages and writing systems.
        The difference between Unicode and ASCII is that Unicode uses more than one byte to represent each character,
        allowing it to represent more characters. Not only does it include characters from other languages but also 
        represents emojis, symbols and characters from different scripts.
    </p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8?</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8) is a character encoding system that represents characters using
        one to four bytes and is the most common character encoding on the web.
    </p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a web page. As the name implies, it is a universal Locator
        that can be accessed from any browser that has access the the interent and the web. 
    </p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>A domain name is a user friendly, text-based address that identifies a website on the internet.
        Unlike IP addresses, domain names are designed to be easily remembered by humans, like "google.com"
        instead of "172.217.160.142".
    </p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol". It's the computer communication protocol used for most 
        communication on the world wide web. When you visit a website, your browser sends a HTTP request to the 
        web server, which responds with a HTTP response.
    </p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTPS is the same as HTTP, but with an S, meaning secure. As the name suggests, HTTPS is a more secure
        version as the data is encrypted before it is transferred.
    </p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device connected
        to the internet. 
    </p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is like the phonebook of the internet. Humans access information
        online through domain names, web browsers interact through IP addresses and DNS translates domain names to
        IP addresses so broweser can load internet resources. DNS eliminates the need for humans to memorize IP 
        addresses like google was mentioned earlier.
    </p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) Recommendations refers to a set of standards or guidelines published
        by the W3C to define how web technologies should function to promote consistency and interoperabilty
        across platforms and browsers.
    </p>
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>All these different acronyms are all "mark up languages", meaning that they are systems for marking or tagging
        a document that indicates its logical structure and gives instruction for its layout to be displayed.
    </p>
    <h4>XML</h4>
    <p>XML (Extensible Markup Language), started in 1996 and first published in 1998 by W3C Recommendation.</p>
    <h4>XHTML</h4>
    <p> XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language)</p>
    <h4>HTML</h4>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language</p>
    <h4>HTML5</h4>
    <p>5th version of HTML</p>
