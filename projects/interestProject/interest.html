    <main><p>Barbering is an interest of mine that I have quite the interesting relationship with. I cut hair quite often, and I would say that I'm better than the average person at cutting hair, however, my dilemma is that I actually don't enjoy cutting hair too much. The only reason why I started cutting hair was to cut my own hair on the mission to save money. Long story short, people started asking for haircuts after they found out I cut hair and here I am now, cutting hair when I can find the time amongst my now busy schedule.</p>
    <p>The thing about barbering for me that has me contemplating is that it can be quite lucrative. The average barber these days charge about $35 USD per haircut (from my own estimation), however, I've seen many barber on social media charging upwards of $100 per cut, some charging a whopping $250 per cut, and consistently getting booked out. One of the biggest barbers I follow is named <a href="hero.html">Hakeem Hoang</a>. One of the many reasons I look up to him is that he is also from Australia (like myself) and he is currently training barbers to become as successful as he is.

    <p>The reason barbeing also interests me is the satisfaction of a crisp haircut. You not only take hair off a client's head, but you leave them with the confidence to do whatever they want, if you execute the haircut well. It's always hit or miss when you first begin but once you get consistent, it can be very satisfying. </p>

    <p>Relative links are links within the website/root folder. Like the name implies, it uses family relative names to help describe locations of the links. Here are some example of the terminology:</p>

    <h4><span class="my-id">Absolute links</span></h4>
