                Barbering has been around since ancient times, with barbers playing important roles in both society and religion. Back in Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, they weren't just cutting hair—they were also performing grooming rituals for priests, warriors, and the upper class. During the Middle Ages, barbers took on even more responsibilities, like minor surgeries, bloodletting, and even pulling teeth—this is how the "barber-surgeon" profession came to be. The classic red and white barber pole actually comes from this era, representing blood and bandages. By the late 1700s, barbers and surgeons went their separate ways, and barbering became all about grooming once again.

                In the 19th and 20th centuries, barbering really took off with the opening of barber schools and the invention of specialized tools like the straight razor. Barbershops became more than just places to get a haircut—they were community hubs, especially in the U.S., where men from all walks of life would gather.
                Things changed in the mid-1900s when unisex salons and at-home grooming became more popular, causing a decline in traditional barbering. But in the 21st century, barbershops made a big comeback, mixing classic techniques with modern styles. Today, they offer a mix of old-school and contemporary services, once again becoming key spots for both grooming and socializing.
