                What is AJAX?
                <p>
                    AJAX stands for <strong>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</strong>. It's a technique used in web development to create dynamic, interactive web applications. AJAX allows a web page to update parts of the page without reloading the entire page. This improves the user experience by making websites faster and more responsive:
                    <p>Here's how it works:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Asychronous:</strong> AJAX allows communication with the server in the background without interrupting the user's interaction with the page. When a request is made, the rest of the page can still be interacted with.</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: JavaScript is used to send the request to the server and handle the server's repsonse.</li>
                        <li><strong>XML (or JSON)</strong>: Originally, the data exchanged between the client and server was in XML format, but now JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is mroe commonlyused due to its simplicity and ease of use.</li>
                        <li>
                        <strong>HTTP Requests:</strong>
                        AJAX uses the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object (or the newer Fetch API) to send requests to the server and retrieve data asychronously.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Why do you put your JS Code in a separate file?
                <p>Keep your HTML separate to your JS Code, keeping things cleaner.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
